# Todo:

1. Improve glitchy rendering on my mac

    - Research double buffering (like brother macbeth mentioned)
    - check all the ints, floats, and doubles and see if there is any sus in number data type casting
    - test my program on somebody else's computer

1. Finish the readme file, add any missing story and include all the docs I bookmarked

1. Make a quick demonstration video

    - Start off in-program
    - Describe the purpose of the project using program as visual aid
        - Don't go through the details yet, save that for the end
    - Go into the project explaining the individual components and the basic structure of the project:
        - use the package explorer to describe what packages exist
        - briefly go over my workflow in VS Code, demonstrate program compilation
        - Explain Asteroids Package
            - houses driver
            - includes Game package:
        - Explain Game Package
            - houses Asteroids (Game) class
            - at one point, go over the Handle Events section of this class, and demonstrate each of the controls listed in the code.
            - includes Asteroids.Objects package:
        - Explain Objects package
            - Explain FlyingObject class
            - Briefly go over each individual object
    - Go through the sprint requirements and stretch requirements and identify how and to what extent I've fulfilled them.
    - Open program again, and use it while in conversation for a few seconds
    - Finish off by explaining what obviously needs improvement (prepare this beforehand) and, while you're at it, ask for any suggestions! It would be kind of cool to see what feedback you get :)
