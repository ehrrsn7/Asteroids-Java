Welcome to Java Asteroids! This program is a game. ** Deliverable coming soon. **

*[* Demonstration video goes here *]()*

## Development History

Version 0.0 - Java Project created<br>
Version 0.1 - Game Loop and JFrame created<br>
Version 0.2 - Graphics working properly [See demonstration video here](https://youtu.be/7VTV3HpEoC4)<br>

## Development Environment

Coded using Visual Studio Code (See this [Visual Studio Code tutorial on setting up Java workflow](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java))

## Notes:

Look up ```.clone()``` to 'duplicate' simple objects (shallow objects) -- specifically to duplicate "```point```" from ```ship``` in ```ship.fire()``` to pass to ```laser```

(note -- Brother Macbeth told me that this method doesn't work very well as a 'deep' duplicator. Aka it's fine to use with a ```point``` object but not very effective in copying very large objects.)
